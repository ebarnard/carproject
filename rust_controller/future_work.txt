- Initialise mulitpliers for softening to be same as cost funciton mulitpliers
- Recursive feasibility
  - Approximate
    - Constrain final N horizon points to lie on the line of least curvature (as a good guess for the racing line)
  - Almost Exact
    - Constrain final point to lie on a recursively feasible trajectory
    - Ideally this is the largest hyper-cube in state space that is recursively feasible
    - Initially constrain 'a' (deviation from race line), deviation from race line angle, and maximum speed
- Estimator outlier reduction
  - Chi-squared percentile test
- Estimator performance improvement
  - Historical batch estiamtion
- When car is perpendicular to the centreline and not moving it is unable to make progress with the distance maximising controller
- Reset some inputs to zero if horizon crosses track boundary
